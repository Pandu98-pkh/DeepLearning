- **Embedding Dimension**: 128
- **Task**: Binary sentiment classification (Positive/Negative)

## Model Architectures

### 1. Simple RNN
**Mathematical Formulation:**
- Hidden State: h_t = tanh(W_hh · h_{t-1} + W_xh · x_t + b_h)
- Output: y_t = W_hy · h_t + b_y

**Characteristics:**
- Simplest architecture
- Fastest training
- Prone to vanishing gradient problem
- Best for short sequences

### 2. LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)
**Mathematical Formulation:**
- Forget Gate: f_t = σ(W_f · [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_f)
- Input Gate: i_t = σ(W_i · [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_i)
- Cell State: C_t = f_t ⊙ C_{t-1} + i_t ⊙ tanh(W_C · [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_C)
- Output Gate: o_t = σ(W_o · [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_o)
- Hidden State: h_t = o_t ⊙ tanh(C_t)

**Characteristics:**
- Most complex architecture
- Best for long sequences
- Solves vanishing gradient problem
- Highest parameter count

### 3. GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit)
**Mathematical Formulation:**
- Reset Gate: r_t = σ(W_r · [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_r)
- Update Gate: z_t = σ(W_z · [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_z)
- Candidate Hidden State: h̃_t = tanh(W_h · [r_t ⊙ h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_h)
- Hidden State: h_t = (1 - z_t) ⊙ h_{t-1} + z_t ⊙ h̃_t

**Characteristics:**
- Balanced complexity
- Good performance-efficiency trade-off
- Fewer parameters than LSTM
- Often comparable performance to LSTM
